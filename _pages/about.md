Hey there! I'm a Software Developer at Garuda Labs and a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/). I love building things, optimizing systems, and making the most out of available resources. Also, Iâ€™d prefer not to be replaced by AI (for now).

In my free time, I explore new technologies, play badminton and other sports, and attempt (often unsuccessfully) to write poetry and blogs.

This blurb may or may not have been written by an AI.
